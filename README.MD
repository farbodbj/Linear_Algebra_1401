# Linear Algebra Homeworks

This repository contains my homework assignments for the Linear Algebra course taught by [Professor Maryam Amir Mazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en) at Amirkabir University of Technology. The assignments are focused on practical applications of linear algebra concepts and all the implementations has been done in python and using numpy library.
## Homework Descriptions
### Homework 1: Gaussian Elimination and Row Operations
In this assignment, I implemented algorithms for solving linear systems using Gaussian elimination and row operations. The Python code takes in a matrix as input and returns the solution to the system of equations. The implementation is based on the algorithm provided in the textbook.
### Homework 2: Transpose and Determinant Functions

In this assignment, I explored the practical uses of transpose and determinant functions in linear algebra. The Python code calculates the transpose and determinant of a given matrix and tries to maximize the determinant of a special type of matrices (provided in the exercise).
### Homework 3: Error Detection and Correction with Hamming Code

In this assignment, I implemented the Hamming code method to detect and correct errors in digital data transmission. The Python code generates error-correcting codes and demonstrates how to detect and correct bit errors.
### Homework 4: Power Method, Inverse Power Method, QR Factorization, and Gram-Schmidt Algorithm

In this assignment, I implemented algorithms for finding the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix using the power method and inverse power method. I also implemented the QR factorization and Gram-Schmidt algorithms to find an orthonormal basis for the column space of a matrix which were co-related. The Python code includes test cases for each algorithm which are relatively large matrices. The correctness is being tested using numpy's in-built testing functionalities.
### Homework 5: SVD and Dimension Reduction

In this assignment, I used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform dimension reduction on a dataset of food data (NNDB dataset). The Python code first reads and pre-proccess the data as a pandas dataframe and then  reduces the dimensionality of the dataset using SVD and other formulas and reports the error after the reduction. The data is also visualized using Matplotlib.

## Note
Please note that my code is not error-free and may not always work perfectly. I have implemented some functions in numpy or other Python packages by myself for learning purposes.
