#Linear Algebra Homeworks#

This repository contains my homework assignments for the Linear Algebra course taught by Professor Maryam Amir Mazlaghani at the University of Amirkabir. The assignments are focused on practical applications of linear algebra concepts in Python.
Homework Descriptions
Homework 1: Gaussian Elimination and Row Operations

In this assignment, I implemented algorithms for solving linear systems using Gaussian elimination and row operations. The Python code takes in a matrix as input and returns the solution to the system of equations. The implementation is based on the algorithm provided in the textbook.
Homework 2: Transpose and Determinant Functions

In this assignment, I explored the practical uses of transpose and determinant functions in linear algebra. The Python code calculates the transpose and determinant of a given matrix and demonstrates their properties.
Homework 3: Error Detection and Correction with Hamming Code

In this assignment, I implemented the Hamming code method to detect and correct errors in digital data transmission. The Python code generates error-correcting codes and demonstrates how to detect and correct bit errors.
Homework 4: Power Method, Inverse Power Method, QR Factorization, and Gram-Schmidt Algorithm

In this assignment, I implemented algorithms for finding the dominant eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix using the power method and inverse power method. I also implemented the QR factorization and Gram-Schmidt algorithm to find an orthonormal basis for the column space of a matrix. The Python code includes test cases for each algorithm.
Homework 5: SVD and Dimension Reduction

In this assignment, I used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to perform dimension reduction on a dataset of food data (NNDB dataset). The Python code reduces the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA and other formulas and reports the error after the reduction. The data is also visualized using Matplotlib.
Note

Please note that my code is not error-free and may not always work perfectly. I have implemented some functions in numpy or other Python packages by myself for learning purposes.

Overall, this repository demonstrates my abilities to apply linear algebra concepts in Python and showcases my understanding of the algorithms and their practical applications.
